# RecursionPractice

Create this functions:
1. list_len/1 - to calculate list length
2. range/2 - return list numbers from one number (from) to another (to)
3. positive/1 - get one list and return another list with only positive numbers

First do it with recursion next do it with tail recursion

## Run tests

```
mix test
```
