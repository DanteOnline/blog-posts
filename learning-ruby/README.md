# Learning Ruby

In this category I will write about **ruby**. 
I will learn ruby myself by books, using [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/DanteOnline)

The main goal is to be able to create professional ruby projects and contribute to existing open source projects
like [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/), [diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) and others
